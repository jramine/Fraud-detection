# Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a neural network and the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method to balance the data. Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, and machine learning techniques like neural networks can be effective in identifying suspicious activities.

### Project Goals

- Develop a robust credit card fraud detection system.
- Utilize a neural network for pattern recognition in transaction data.
- Address class imbalance using the SMOTE technique.
- Achieve high accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions.

### Key Components

1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset is preprocessed, and features are engineered to make it suitable for training the neural network. This includes handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **SMOTE for Balancing Data:** The SMOTE technique is applied to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples of the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

3. **Neural Network Model:** A neural network architecture is designed for classification, with appropriate activation functions, layers, and optimization techniques.

4. **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on the balanced dataset and evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Deployment:** The trained model can be deployed in a production environment for real-time credit card fraud detection.
